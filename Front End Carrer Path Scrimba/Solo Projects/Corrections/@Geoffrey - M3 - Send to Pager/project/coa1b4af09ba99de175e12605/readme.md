## What you've done well

- design looks good; everything is polished, well centered, using the container technique.
- HTML markup is of good quality, well-strctured and indented
- querySelectorAll + forEach to create multiple event listeners works well
- event.target.
- creation of smalle functions
- DOM manipulation
- display: grid and grid-template-columns: well done!

## What could be improved

[x] title must not be empty.
[x] downloading google fonts but not using them => wasted bandwidth
[x] can delete some unnecessary markup <p>
[x] group up your js file by type, and or add comments
[x] avoid using ID selectors for CSS => specificity

[x] /_ grid-template-rows: repeat(4,1fr); _/
[x] maybe reset the Pager display too
[x] hover effects on buttons
[x] semantic elements

## Stretch goal / refactor

[x] In the next JS module, you will study data attributes: they will allow you to refactor your app to only use 1 event listeners for all the buttons
[x] Never trust the user. Let's break your app by inputting alot of numbers.

- limit user input - no more than 6 numbers
- change your CSS

## Debate

Should comments be written in English, or in our native language? It depends on the project.
