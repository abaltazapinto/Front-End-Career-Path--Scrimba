1. No alt tied with the images, is important to web acessibility.
2. Well done with the use of class for each activity  and then well done with the inherent css.
3. You can change the class bold for the <b> where you want the bold cause the will always to bold your content for example: <b>Game Drives and Wildlife Viewing</b> will bold what you have in between.
4. Good job in cascading the titles and subtitles. 
5. You can really use more padding in between the activities to clear the reading !!!!
6. Having in mind contrast purposes i would add a border to the  images like this 
		.img {
		    width: 100px;
		    height: 100px;
		    border-radius: 50%;
		    border: 2px solid black;
		}
7. Well done with your project !
	
Pros
Really good way to present your country gave the will to visit now :D
Good job in cascading titles  and subtitles.
Well done with the card representing the guide. I appreciate the touch in the margin-bottom.
Cons
You To start to write code about thinking in web acesssibility (alt, aria-label, labeletc...)
Using well some features in HTML that facilitates our duty (using <b> <em> <s> etc...)
excessive css on the id= profile just that that matters  
  display: flex;
  flex-direction:row;

I would say to have a margin in th activity css to be easy to read like this : 

.activity{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 10px 10px;
}
