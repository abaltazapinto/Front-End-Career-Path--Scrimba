Fundamental of ui design

    > White space
    > Color
    > COntrast
    > Scale
    > Alignment
    > Typography
    > Visual Hierarchy


just learned another thing is just using 
                                        > display grid
                                            and then place-content: center;

                                        it is important that the container of you element should have 100vh;
