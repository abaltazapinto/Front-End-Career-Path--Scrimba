in this scrim i learned that i need to learn how to work in a way that the hidden visibility works uin a way for everybody if you invisual or not liuke that for everyone. 
One way to achieve this instead of using display: none or visibility : hidden (cause also hides from the visibility tree we can use CSS or opacity for screen readers).
