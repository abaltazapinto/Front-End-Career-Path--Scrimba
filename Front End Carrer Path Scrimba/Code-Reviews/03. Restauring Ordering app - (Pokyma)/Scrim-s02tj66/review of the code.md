First of all congratulations on completed this project is one step ahead in your carreer as devellopper.

- The structure is clear and supports acessibility by separating content meaningfully.
- Great use of CSS variables (--black --white etc... ) actually i suse this for dark and white themes. NIce.
- Error handling: calidateion with checkValidity in handlePaySubmit is a thioughtfull touch.
- I enjoyed the use of e.target.blur() is well applied and is a really cool stuff.

Areas of improvement:
- The font family of the price is not as the figma file . In that case should be 'Smythe'. Be attentive to this kind of things.
- The format of the card number, and CVV is not within the limits "Payment card numbers can vary in length but typically range from 8 to 19 digits". Ive try with numbers outside the rule and the program worked anyway. 
- Lack of ARIA roles.
- Seantic enhancements div -> section for example in <div id="menu">
- Refactoring Repeated logic
- Erase console.logs from the production build code

COngrats :
Your code demonstrates a strong understanding of modern web practices. The thoughtful use of Flexbox, CSS variables, and modular JavaScript is awesome. With a few refinements in scalability, accessibility, and responsiveness, this project could serve as a stellar example of best practices.
