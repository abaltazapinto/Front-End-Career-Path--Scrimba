Certainly, here's a recap of the `slice()` method in JavaScript:

**Purpose:**

* Extracts a portion of an array and returns a new array containing the extracted elements. 
* Does **not** modify the original array.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
array.slice(begin, end)
```

* **`begin`:** The index of the first element to include in the new array. 
    * If omitted, defaults to 0 (the beginning of the array).
    * If negative, counts from the end of the array.
* **`end`:** The index of the element **before** which to stop extracting. 
    * If omitted, extracts until the end of the array.
    * If negative, counts from the end of the array.

**Examples:**

1. **Extract elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive):**

   ```javascript
   const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "mango"];
   const citrusFruits = fruits.slice(1, 4); // ["banana", "orange", "grape"] 
   ```

2. **Extract elements from the beginning to index 2:**

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const firstThree = numbers.slice(0, 3); // [1, 2, 3]
   ```

3. **Extract elements from index 2 to the end:**

   ```javascript
   const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"];
   const lastTwo = colors.slice(2); // ["blue", "yellow"]
   ```

4. **Extract elements from the end of the array:**

   ```javascript
   const letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
   const lastTwoLetters = letters.slice(-2); // ["c", "d"] 
   ```

5. **Extract no elements (empty array):**

   ```javascript
   const animals = ["dog", "cat", "bird"];
   const emptyArray = animals.slice(2, 2); // []
   ```

**Key Points:**

* `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the extracted elements. 
* If you need to modify the extracted portion without affecting the original array, `slice()` is the ideal method.

I hope this recap is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
In a nutshell:

slice() is like taking a snapshot of a part of the array. It creates a new array with the selected elements, leaving the original array unchanged.
splice() is like surgery on the array. It modifies the original array by adding, removing, or replacing elements at a specific position.
Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

Feature	slice()	splice()
Purpose	Create a new array with a portion of the original	Modify the original array
Effect on original array	No change	Changes the original array
Returns	A new array with the selected elements	An array containing the removed elements (if any)
